# i3 4.20 added support for systemd notify:
# https://github.com/i3/i3/blob/4.20/RELEASE-NOTES-4.20
Type=notify
ExecStart=i3
# TODO: This isn't getting triggered when I do `systemctl restart lightdm`, and
# may not work for reboot too. Need to figure this out.
ExecStop=%h/.my_scripts/i3/i3-resurrect-wrapper save --all
# Using `i3-msg exit` seems to cause i3 to exit with 143, which usually means
# it was killed with SIGTERM [1]. This makes systemd think that the unit failed
# although it didn't, so we use SuccessExitStatus to suppress it.
