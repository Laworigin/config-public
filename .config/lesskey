# NOTE: The correct way to get the key sequence from a given terminal is to
# start less (`echo $TERM | less`), enter search by typing "/", and then
# using Ctrl-v like in the shell. This is different than doing it directly in
# the shell, because when less is run the terminal mode can be set to
# "application" mode, whereas in bash this is usually set to "normal" mode. See

#env
# I don't set my less(1) related environment variables here anymore. I do it in
# my `~/.zshenv' file. If all variables are set in the shell, I can also change
# them in the shell, this uncomfortable, compared to changing them here and
# reÂ­running `lesskey' each time I experiment with something
